# Student Management System 
This is a Simple Student Management System, which allows the student, professor as well as the administration staff to perform CRUD operations

## Motivation
We felt that students donâ€™t get much clarity and ease while obtaining their marks and results in various subjects and for teachers it gets especially difficult to manage so many subject marks and grades for hundreds of students. Due to this sometimes result gets delayed or even in some cases misplaced which affect both the students and the teachers.

We thought to solve this problem by building a management system that will serve as a ecosystem for both the teachers and students, and provide various useful features by taking help of modern day technology.

This will be a one stop solution for the teachers as well as the students, instead of maintaining and following the older norms of storing records in files, this will aim at automating it for the mutual benefit of both
